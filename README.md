IT FITS
=======

## Version 2.0.0

Its an HTML5 CSS3 Responsive Template, with 5 pages excluding 404 page. This template has something not just merely HTML5 new tags, it’s coded using WAI-ARIA roles for enhanced quality. Uses very less images, taking benefits from CSS3 features. Even icons are fonts – hmm super fast page loading.
